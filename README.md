Introduction to HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to structure the content of a web page. It uses elements and attributes to define the structure and content of a web page.

Basic Syntax:

The basic syntax of an HTML element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The start tag is written using an angle bracket (<), the element name, and a closing angle bracket (>). The end tag is written using an angle bracket (<), a forward slash (/), the element name, and a closing angle bracket (>).

<element>Content</element>

HTML Elements:
HTML elements define the structure and content of a web page. Examples of common HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and tables.

HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes provide additional information about an element. They are added to the start tag of an element and are written in the form of an attribute name and an attribute value, separated by an equal sign (=).

<element attribute="value">Content</element>


HTML Form:
An HTML form allows a user to input data and send it to a server for processing. In this document, a basic form example is provided which includes fields for name, email, message, and a select option for a topic.

Conclusion:
This document provides a basic introduction to HTML, including information on syntax, elements, attributes, and forms. With this knowledge, you can start creating your own HTML documents and building basic web pages.
