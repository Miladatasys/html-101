<!--
<!DOCTYPE html> declares the type of the HTML document.
<html> is the root element of an HTML document and contains all the other elements on the page.
<head> contains meta information about the document, such as the character encoding and the title of the page.
<meta charset="UTF-8"> defines the character encoding used in the document.
<title>My HTML 101 Document</title> provides a title for the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar.
<body> contains the content of the HTML document.
<h1>My HTML 101 Document</h1> is a heading element that provides a top-level heading for the document.
<nav> is a section of a page that contains navigation links.
<ul> is an unordered list element that contains a list of items, each of which is marked with a bullet point.
<li><a href="#about">About</a></li> is a list item that contains a link to a section of the page with the id "about".
<header> is a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
This is just a simple example, but it should give you an idea of how these elements can be used together to create a basic HTML document header.

The <pre> tag in HTML is used to define preformatted text. Preformatted text is text that is displayed exactly as it is written in the HTML code, 
preserving white space and line breaks. The text within a <pre> tag is typically displayed in a fixed-width font, such as Courier, and is usually used
to display code snippets or other text that is meant to be displayed in a specific format.

In the above example, the footer contains two elements:

A copyright notice, denoted by the "Â©" symbol, which indicates the year of publication and the name of the document.
A navigation menu, which contains links to "About" and "Contact" pages. The links are denoted by the "a" elements and their destinations 
are specified using the "href" attributes. 
The navigation menu is contained within a "nav" element and the links are listed using an unordered list "ul" element.

The <footer> tag in HTML is used to define a footer for a document or section. A footer typically contains information about the author of the document
or section, copyright information, links to related documents, and so on. The footer element is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions.


Page structure:
-Heading tags are have 6 sizes and is used for emphasize key words 
<h1></h1> (Main category)
<h2></h2> (sub heading)
<h3></h3> as we go down we can have subheadings off of the main one
LOREM IPSUM it's text that is used for place holding whithing website design
<p></p> are paragraph but don't nest inside one another, also you can use headings to break apart those contents but is not necessary
<br> is other way to separate paragraph or elements with spaces 

Lists:
<ol></ol> order list tag
-We need a starting point and a finishing point:
<li></li> set the list format with numbers by default
-We can change numbers to letters writing <ol type="a" </ol>, there's a number of different types of lists
<type="A" up to uppercase
<>type="i" for roman numerals
<type="I" uppercase roman num
-If we want to specify the starting point, we use the <ol start=""></ol> attribute
<ul></ul> stand for unorder list
-If we need order list items, we can put them inside the unordered list:
<ul><li>element of the list</li></ul> instead of using num/char to give order, we use the bullet points by default (you order the elements inside the code)

HyperLinks and bookmarks:
<a></a> are links 
-EXTERNAL LINKS:    
<ul><li><a>First link</a></li><ul> we can set the links inside an specific list
-But first we need additionally attributes and these attributes within hyperlinks and this is going to allow us to specify what web page we want:
-FIRST WAY: EXTERNAL LINK
<a href="https://www.google.com"> it used to go what webpage we want to go (default html for hyperlinks) we can go to an external source too like google
-SECOND WAY: ANOTHER WEB PAGE
<a href="contact.html" allows us to go to a web page
<target="_blank" is another good practice to maintain visitors

-THIRD WAY: CURRENT WEB PAGE
<a ref=""> but we need to set an attribute that we'll hep us to find the link inside the page easily:
<li id="Third item"></li> and the <li><a href="#third item</a></li>
-FOURTH WAY: EMAIL LINK
<a href="mailto:"> it's going to open up the email client and it's going to fill in the email address for us
-We can also add a subject line to the email:
<a href="mailto:
?subject=subject line"> it's going to open up the email client and it's going to fill in the email address for us


-BOOKMARKS:
<a href="#top">Top</a> it's going to take us to the top of the page
<a href="#bottom">Bottom</a> it's going to take us to the bottom of the page
<a href="#contact">Contact</a> it's going to take us to the contact section of the page
<a href="#about">About</a> it's going to take us to the about section of the page
<a href="#services">Services</a> it's going to take us to the services section of the page
<a href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a> it's going to take us to the portfolio section of the page
<a href="#testimonials">Testimonials</a> it's going to take us to the testimonials section of the page

CSS styling:
-We can select any of our element or content and give them style by <style></style>
{ } to specify the properties inside style that we want to look like
-styling allows to use our id (it's has to be unique) we can add it after { } with #attribute or list or in the same element: <h2 id="sub header" style="">Sub header</h2>
-but it's better to keep you style in one area (top area probably)
-if we want to style multiple elements we can use another attribute called class:
-<p class="highlight"> it always has to be meaningful </p>
-for classes we uses . in order to represent thoses classes, example: .highlight {background-color=violet;}
